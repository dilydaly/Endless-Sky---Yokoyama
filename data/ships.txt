	description "A concept created late in the 20th century. Recently, an old and nostalgic engineer has started bringing these designs to life."
	description "An old starfighter design, from the early days of human space activities. Has 5 gun bays and ample engine space, however it comes pre-configured to be a game changer."
	description "It takes a pilot of exceptional skill with a craving for challenge to fly this ship. Come back when you've gained some experience."
